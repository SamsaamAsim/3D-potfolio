Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website! This project showcases my skills and projects using a unique and interactive 3D island environment built with React. Instead of traditional navigation, users explore the island to find different sections.

* **Sections:** Includes standard portfolio sections like About Me, Skills, Projects, and Contact.
* **Engaging UI:** A unique approach compared to standard portfolio templates.
* **Responsive Design:** (e.g., Adapts to different screen sizes for accessibility.)

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** React, JavaScript
* **3D Rendering:** (e.g., React Three Fiber, Three.js)
* **Styling:** (e.g., CSS Modules, Tailwind CSS)
* **Deployment:** Vercel

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

**Prerequisites:**

* Node.js (v16 or later recommended)
* npm or yarn

**Installation & Setup:**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/SamsaamAsim/3D-potfolio.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/SamsaamAsim/3D-potfolio.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd 3D-potfolio
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # OR if you use yarn
    # yarn install
    ```
4.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev 
    # OR if you use yarn
    # yarn dev 
    # Note: create-react-app uses `npm start` / `yarn start`. Check your package.json `scripts` section. I am assuming vite setup (`dev`) is used. Update if needed.
    ```
5.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port specified in your terminal, typically 3000 for create-react-app).
